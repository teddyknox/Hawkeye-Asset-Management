How does anyone predict the movement of stocks?
	- financial news (AP, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, New York Times)
	- financial metrics (Quarterly Investor reports, Treasury reports, Time series analysis)

How did we?
	- financial news

What news did we use?
	- First we scraped Google Finance (screenshot?)
		- but that only goes back 14 days
	- Then we started scraping Reuters
		- but that doesn't go back far enough either
	- Finally we got excited about searching Twitter for news story links...
		- but found that their search index was limited to 7 days.
		- So naturally we used the twitter data.

How did we scrape?
	- Searched Twitter for '$AAPL' or whatever
	- extract links from tweets
	- use the Readability API to get article body and content from those links.

Stock data
	- Yahoo Finance API
	- Bloomberg machine in the library 
	- both not so fun

Problem Conception
	- Supervised learning problem
